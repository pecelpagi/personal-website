        ðŸ‘‹ Hi. My name is Galuh Muhamad Ramadhan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been working in software engineering for more than 7 years. I have good knowledge of frontend and backend.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always try my best when building or developing software, so I always keep my code as tidy as possible and refactor periodically. I prefer to break my code into smaller chunks so it's easier to read. My skillset includes:
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming Languages<br />
        - Java, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6), SQL, PHP, Python
      </p>
      <p>
        Libraries & Frameworks<br />
        - Spring, Django, React, Redux-Saga, Jest, CodeIgniter, Laravel
      </p>
      <p>
        Tools & Platforms<br />
        - Git, Node.js, Docker, Jenkins, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes
      </p>
      <p>
        Databases<br />
        - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
      </p>
      <p>
        I am adaptable and eager to learn new development tools. In my spare time I like to study new technologies and techniques to improve the quality of software.
      </p>
